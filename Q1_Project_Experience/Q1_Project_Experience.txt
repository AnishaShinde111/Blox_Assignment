Elaborate what your internship or academic projects were? 
 
a. What did the system do?
b. What other systems have you seen in the wild like that? 

I have been working with NSE client for 2.5 years, developing and maintaining several java based applications.
Currently I am working on an applications called Surviellance NGS, SEBI.
NGS Surviellance application is used to monitor the price band changes in live share market, collect all the order trade data and populate in DB using real time data streaming technologies like Kafka brokers. Once the data is populated in database, various reports are generated by end user via frontend login.
In SEBI application, all the order trade data is written into .txt files throughout the day. At EOD, all these files are zipped and stored as .tar files, ready to being SFTP to a intermeiate serevr. From here SEBI authorities can fetch the corresponding files.


c. How do you approach the development problem?

Once a new requirement is recived below plan of action is followed by team:
- Impact analysis for required changes
- Identify different possible solutions and selecting most optimized approach satisfying all test cases and constraints
- Breaking down code changes into smaller tasks to be completed in short timelines
- Priortizing tasks and dividing them among the team to meet deadlines
- Holding timely internal meetings to take update on work progress, discuss various challenges faced by team, finding alternative solutions
- Maintain source code repository using tools like GIT/SVN
- Ensure code test cases with JUnit/ Mockito integration
- User Acceptance Testing to be verify if solution is satisfying
- Release documentation to be done properly to maintain file changes history


d. What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow? 
e. What did you learn from some very specific copy paste? Mention explicitly some of them?

Websites like Stack Overflow were blocked to be used from to avoid copying code from external sources or releasing code to external sources.
But sites like GeeksForGeeks, W3Schools, Jabatpoint, etc can be useful to deal with syntax errors or trying, comparing different solutions, solve various run time errors or debugging.
Among many of such cases, one situation includes scenario where heap jar used to fail in an environment as its heap memory will be exceeded. To solve this error max heap memory size assigned to particular jar file was increased in .xml file.
